### Description

React Static Template is a boilerplate for React apps that has a simple one-page layout
(no routing), markdown compatibility, and plays well with GitHub pages.

<br>

This project is inspired by [React Static Boilerplate][rsb]. The Webpack and Node.js 
configuration, as well as the markdown loader, is borrowed and adapted from React Static Boilerplate.

<br>

React Static Template is written by and maintained by [Michael Sargent][mksarge].
