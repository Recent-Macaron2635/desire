### Description

React Static Template is a boilerplate for React apps with a simple one-page layout (no routing)
and markdown compatibility. The code for the Webpack and Node.js configuration, as well
as the markdown loader, are borrowed and adapted from [React Static Boilerplate][rsb].

React Static Template was created by Michael Sargent ([@mksarge](https://github.com/mksarge)).
